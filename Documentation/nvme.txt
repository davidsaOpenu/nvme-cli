NAME
----
nvme - the dumb pci-e storage utility

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme' <command> <device> [<args>] 

DESCRIPTION
-----------
NVM-Express is a fast, scalabale host controller interface designed to
address the needs for PCI Express based solida state drives.

This 'nvme' program is a user space utility to provide standards compliant
tooling for NVM-Express drives. It was made specifically for Linux as
it relies on the IOCTLs defined by the mailine kernel driver.

NVME COMMANDS
-------------
The utility has sub-commands for all admin and io commands defined in the
specification and for displaying controller registers. There is also an
option to submit completely arbitrary commands. For a list of commands
available, run "nvme help".
